# Angular-Mobile-application-utilizing-third-party-APIs
A mobile web app built on the AngularJS framework that queries third-party image APIs and retrieves information for users.

## Project Overview

This project is a mobile web app that uses APIs to search a variety of public image hosting sites for a user input keyword.  the application then creates an integrated list fo the results from each site and can provide host information on each photo.

## Features

-Examples of API calls to a variety of sources
-Integration of responses from the API cals to create a single stream of information

## Installation

The only neccessary instalation is Apache Tomcat to host the web application.  if you have Angular installed, you can also host the project through that.

## Usage

1. Website can be hosted on a local Apache tomcat server
2. For production use, you'll want to utilize your own API keys
